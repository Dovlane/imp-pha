before_pump_id - there was only a PID used for the servovalve signal
after_pump_id - besides PID for servovalve signal, I added also a PID for a pump


I would say that piston position follows desired position with similiar efficiency before and
after adding same PID*

*Unfortunately I changed pulse frequency for after_pump_id to be twice slower than before.
